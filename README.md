# Harris Detector and SIFT Matcher

This repository contains a project focused on analyzing, implementing, and testing two distinct methods for image feature extraction and matching: the Harris Detector with Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC) and the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) Matcher. The initial objective is to evaluate these methods in general scenarios to determine their comparative performance. Subsequently, the superior method will be applied to locate specific regions within a satellite image.
