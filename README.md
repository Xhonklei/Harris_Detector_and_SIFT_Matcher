# Harris Detector and SIFT Matcher

This repository contains a project focused on analyzing, implementing, and testing two distinct methods for image feature extraction and matching: the Harris Detector with Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC) and the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) Matcher. The initial objective is to evaluate these methods in general scenarios to determine their comparative performance. Subsequently, the superior method will be applied to locate specific regions within a satellite image.

## Repository Content

1. **`QA_model_with_BERT.pdf`**  
   A detailed report describing the project, including the model architecture, training process, usage instructions, and additional insights.

2. **`BERT_QA_Model.ipynb`**  
   A Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training and evaluating the model.

3. **`BERT_QA_ModelTesting.ipynb`**  
   A Jupyter Notebook for testing the trained model on different examples.

## Suggested Workflow

For a better understanding, it is recommended to first read the **report** to get an overview of the project and then proceed to explore and run the **code**.
